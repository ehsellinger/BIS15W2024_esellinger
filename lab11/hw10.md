## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 34786 Columns: 13
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type
## dbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?  

```r
glimpse(deserts)
```

```

#### NAs are treated as `NA` and the data are tidy.

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/least frequently sampled in the study?

```r
deserts %>% 
  summarise(n_genera = n_distinct(genus),
            n_species = n_distinct(species),
            n_total = n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 3
##   n_genera n_species n_total
##      <int>     <int>   <int>
## 1       26        40   34786
```


```r
deserts %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(n_total = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_total))
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species      n_total
##    <chr>          <int>
##  1 merriami       10596
##  2 penicillatus    3123
##  3 ordii           3027
##  4 baileyi         2891
##  5 megalotis       2609
##  6 spectabilis     2504
##  7 torridus        2249
##  8 flavus          1597
##  9 eremicus        1299
## 10 albigula        1252
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```

#### merriami are sampled the most and clarki, scutalatus, tereticaudus, tigris, uniparens, and viridis are sampled the least

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.

```r
tabyl(deserts$taxa)
```

```
##  deserts$taxa     n      percent
##          Bird   450 0.0129362387
##        Rabbit    75 0.0021560398
##       Reptile    14 0.0004024608
##        Rodent 34247 0.9845052607
```


```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", fill = taxa)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) + 
  coord_polar("y") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Taxa Proportions",
       fill = "Taxa")
```

<img src="hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="75%" />

4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxa, fill = plot_type)) +
  geom_bar(position= "dodge") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Taxa by Plot Type",
       x = "Taxa",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Plot Type")
```

<img src="hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="75%" />

5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = T) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Desert Species Weight Ranges",
       x = "Weight (g)",
       y = "Species")
```

<img src="hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="75%" />

6. Add another layer to your answer from #5 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = T) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Desert Species Weight Ranges",
       x = "Weight (g)",
       y = "Species")+
  geom_point(size = .2)
```

```
## Warning: Removed 2503 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

<img src="hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="75%" />

7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?

```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(species == "merriami") %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(year, n), y = n)) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Dipodomys merriami Observations",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count")
```

<img src="hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="75%" />

8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(size = .2) +
  labs(title = "Weight by Hindfoot Length",
       x = "Weight (g)",
       y = "Hindfoot Length (cm)")
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

<img src="hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="75%" />

#### Over plotting is an issue here but `geom_jitter` did not help so I made the points smaller.

9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.

```r
deserts %>% 
  group_by(genus, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'genus'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

```
## # A tibble: 48 × 3
## # Groups:   genus [26]
##    genus        species      mean_weight
##    <chr>        <chr>              <dbl>
##  1 Neotoma      albigula           159. 
##  2 Dipodomys    spectabilis        120. 
##  3 Spermophilus spilosoma           93.5
##  4 Sigmodon     hispidus            73.1
##  5 Sigmodon     fulviventer         58.9
##  6 Sigmodon     ochrognathus        55.4
##  7 Dipodomys    ordii               48.9
##  8 Dipodomys    merriami            43.2
##  9 Chaetodipus  baileyi             31.7
## 10 Onychomys    leucogaster         31.6
## # ℹ 38 more rows
```


```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(genus == "Neotoma" | genus == "Dipodomys") %>% 
  filter(species == "albigula" | species == "spectabilis") %>% 
  filter(weight != "NA") %>% 
  filter(hindfoot_length != "NA") %>% 
  filter(sex != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(weight_hindfoot_ratio = weight/hindfoot_length) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = weight_hindfoot_ratio, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Neotoma albigula vs Dipodomys spectabilis: Weight to Hindfoot Ratio by Sex",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Weight to Hindfoot Ratio",
       fill = "Sex")
```

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.

```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(sex != "NA") %>% 
  filter(weight != "NA") %>% 
  filter(hindfoot_length != "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = weight)) +
  geom_col(aes(color = hindfoot_length)) +
  scale_color_viridis(name = "Hindfoot Length (cm)")+
  labs(title = "Desert Species Sex by Weight and Hindfoot Length",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Weight (g)")
```
